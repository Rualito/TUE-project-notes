How to let the neutral atom quantum computer interact with algorithms related to quantum control and VQE, by using the classical FPGA and neural network infrastructure (nvidia HPC).

We want to obtain the full potential of the quantum computing platform by taking advantage of classical resources (FPGA and HPC). In essence this means obtaining the best possible control loop.
