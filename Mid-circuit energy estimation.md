Find out how to estimate the energy of the state according to a target Hamiltonian, using a scheme similar to [[Optimal Control Variational Quantum Eigensolver#^cc4605|this example]].  

Look at [[An invitation to quantum incompatibility - review]].

One way to obtain the energy mid-circuit is simply through QPE: [[Energy projection with QPE]]
