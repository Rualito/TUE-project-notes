abstract = {Arrays of optically trapped atoms excited to Rydberg states have recently emerged as a competitive physical platform for quantum simulation and computing, where high-fidelity state preparation and readout, quantum logic gates, and controlled quantum dynamics of more than 100 qubits have all been demonstrated. These systems are now approaching the point where reliable quantum computations with hundreds of qubits and realistically thousands of multiqubit gates with low error rates should be within reach for the first time. In this article, the authors give an overview of the Rydberg quantum toolbox, emphasizing the high degree of flexibility for encoding qubits, performing quantum operations, and engineering quantum many-body Hamiltonians. The authors then review the state-of-the-art concerning high-fidelity quantum operations and logic gates as well as quantum simulations in many-body regimes. Finally, the authors discuss computing schemes that are particularly suited to the Rydberg platform and some of the remaining challenges on the road to general purpose quantum simulators and quantum computers.},

abstract = {Quantum error correction protocols will play a central role in the realisation of quantum computing; the choice of error correction code will influence the full quantum computing stack, from the layout of qubits at the physical level to gate compilation strategies at the software level. As such, familiarity with quantum coding is an essential prerequisite for the understanding of current and future quantum computing architectures. In this review, we provide an introductory guide to the theory and implementation of quantum error correction codes. Where possible, fundamental concepts are described using the simplest examples of detection and correction codes, the working of which can be verified by hand. We outline the construction and operation of the surface code, the most widely pursued error correction protocol for experiment. Finally, we discuss issues that arise in the practical implementation of the surface code and other quantum error correction codes.},

abstract = {Variational algorithms for strongly correlated chemical and materials systems are one of the most promising applications of near-term quantum computers. We present an extension to the variational quantum eigensolver that approximates the ground state of a system by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem in a subspace spanned by a collection of parametrized quantum states. This allows for the systematic improvement of a logical wavefunction ansatz without a significant increase in circuit complexity. To minimize the circuit complexity of this approach, we propose a strategy for efficiently measuring the Hamiltonian and overlap matrix elements between states parametrized by circuits that commute with the total particle number operator. This strategy doubles the size of the state preparation circuits but not their depth, while adding a small number of additional two-qubit gates relative to standard variational quantum eigensolver. We also propose a classical Monte Carlo scheme to estimate the uncertainty in the ground state energy caused by a finite number of measurements of the matrix elements. We explain how this Monte Carlo procedure can be extended to adaptively schedule the required measurements, reducing the number of circuit executions necessary for a given accuracy. We apply these ideas to two model strongly correlated systems, a square configuration of H4 and the $\pi$-system of hexatriene (C6H8).},

abstract = {The preparation of quantum states using short quantum circuits is one of the most promising near-term applications of small quantum computers, especially if the circuit is short enough and the fidelity of gates high enough that it can be executed without quantum error correction. Such quantum state preparation can be used in variational approaches, optimizing parameters in the circuit to minimize the energy of the constructed quantum state for a given problem Hamiltonian. For this purpose we propose a simple-to-implement class of quantum states motivated by adiabatic state preparation. We test its accuracy and determine the required circuit depth for a Hubbard model on ladders with up to 12 sites (24 spin orbitals), and for small molecules. We find that this ansatz converges faster than previously proposed schemes based on unitary coupled clusters. While the required number of measurements is astronomically large for quantum chemistry applications to molecules, applying the variational approach to the Hubbard model (and related models) is found to be far less demanding and potentially practical on small quantum computers. We also discuss another application of quantum state preparation using short quantum circuits, to prepare trial ground states of models faster than using adiabatic state preparation.},

abstract = {Observational entropy is interpreted as the uncertainty an observer making measurements associates with a system. So far, properties that make such an interpretation possible rely on the assumption of ideal projective measurements. Here we show that the same properties hold even when considering generalized measurements , and therefore such an interpretation stands completely general. Thus, observational entropy is a well-defined quantifier to test how influential a given series of measurements is in information extraction. Our generalized measurement framework allows us to explore how the measurement probe and schemes influence information extraction, tasks impossible within the projective measurement framework. We provide theoretical lower bounds to the probe dimension and show that a qubit probe can perfectly extract information from any multi-dimensional quantum system. Furthermore, we compare the repeated measurement scheme, in which a pointer repeatedly measures the system of interest, to the repeated contact scheme, in which the pointer repeatedly stores information of the measured observable and is measured only at the end of the protocol. Here, we find that in most cases the repeated contact scheme has a higher observational entropy implying that the observer can extract the most amount of quantum information using this scheme. Finally, we discuss observational entropy as a tool for quantum state inference.

Those algorithms aim to build up optimal circuits for a certain problem and ansatz circuits are adaptively constructed by selecting and adding entanglers from a predefined pool. In this work, we propose a way to construct entangler pools with reduced size by leveraging classical algorithms. Our method uses mutual information between the qubits in classically approximated ground state to rank and screen the entanglers. The density matrix renormalization group method is employed for classical precomputation in this work.We corroborate our method numerically on small molecules. Our numerical experiments show that a reduced entangler pool with a small portion of the original entangler pool can achieve same numerical accuracy.We believe that our method paves a new way for adaptive construction of ansatz circuits for variational quantum algorithms.},

abstract = {Many quantum algorithms, including recently proposed hybrid classical/quantum algorithms, make use of restricted tomography of the quantum state that measures the reduced density matrices, or marginals, of the full state. The most straightforward approach to this algorithmic step estimates each component of the marginal independently without making use of the algebraic and geometric structure of the marginals. Within the field of quantum chemistry, this structure is termed the fermionic n-representability conditions, and is supported by a vast amount of literature on both theoretical and practical results related to their approximations. In this work, we introduce these conditions in the language of quantum computation, and utilize them to develop several techniques to accelerate and improve practical applications for quantum chemistry on quantum computers. As a general result, we demonstrate how these marginals concentrate to diagonal quantities when measured on random quantum states. We also show that one can use fermionic n-representability conditions to reduce the total number of measurements required by more than an order of magnitude for medium sized systems in chemistry. As a practical demonstration, we simulate an efficient restoration of the physicality of energy curves for the dilation of a four qubit diatomic hydrogen system in the presence of three distinct one qubit error channels, providing evidence these techniques are useful for pre-fault tolerant quantum chemistry experiments.},

Numerically exact solutions of the corresponding equations are very challenging to obtain on classical computers. Approximate solutions based on the Davydov ansatz have demonstrated the possibility of stabilized solitonic excitations along the protein, however, experimentally these solutions have never been directly observed. Here we propose an alternative study of biophysical transport phenomena based on a quantum simulator composed of a chain of ultracold dressed Rydberg atoms, which allows for a direct observation of the Davydov phenomena. We show that there is an experimentally accessible range of parameters where the system directly mimics the Davydov equations and their solutions. Moreover, we show that such a quantum simulator has access to the regime in between the small and large polaron regimes, which cannot be described perturbatively.},

abstract = {The variational quantum eigensolver is currently the flagship algorithm for solving electronic structure problems on near-term quantum computers. The algorithm involves implementing a sequence of parameterized gates on quantum hardware to generate a target quantum state, and then measuring the molecular energy. Due to finite coherence times and gate errors, the number of gates that can be implemented remains limited. In this work, we propose an alternative algorithm where device-level pulse shapes are variationally optimized for the state preparation rather than using an abstract-level quantum circuit. In doing so, the coherence time required for the state preparation is drastically reduced. We numerically demonstrate this by directly optimizing pulse shapes which accurately model the dissociation of H2 and HeH+, and we compute the ground state energy for LiH with four transmons where we see reductions in state preparation times of roughly three orders of magnitude compared to gate-based strategies.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

We propose one such unitary operator which can be implemented exactly, circumventing any Taylor or Trotter approximation errors. The second technique is tailored to lattice models, and is targeted at reducing the use of generic single-qubit rotations, which are very expensive to produce by standard fault tolerant techniques. In particular, the number of generic single-qubit rotations used by our method scales with the number of parameters in the Hamiltonian, which contrasts with a growth proportional to the lattice size required by other techniques.},

abstract = {We propose to apply atom-chip techniques to the trapping of a single atom in a circular Rydberg state. The small size of microfabricated structures will allow for trap geometries with microwave cut-off frequencies high enough to inhibit the spontaneous emission of the Rydberg atom, paving the way to complete control of both external and internal degrees of freedom over very long times. Trapping is achieved using carefully designed electric fields, created by a simple pattern of electrodes. We show that it is possible to excite, and then trap, one and only one Rydberg atom from a cloud of ground state atoms confined on a magnetic atom chip, itself integrated with the Rydberg trap. Distinct internal states of the atom are simultaneously trapped, providing us with a two-level system extremely attractive for atom-surface and atom-atom interaction studies. We describe a method for reducing by three orders of magnitude dephasing due to Stark shifts, induced by the trapping field, of the internal transition frequency. This allows for, in combination with spin-echo techniques, maintenance of an internal coherence over times in the second range. This method operates via a controlled light shift rendering the two internal states' Stark shifts almost identical. We thoroughly identify and account for sources of imperfection in order to verify at each step the realism of our proposal. {\textcopyright} EDP Sciences, Societ{\`{a}} Italiana di Fisica, Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract = {Clocks based on optical transitions in ions and atoms are quickly moving to the forefront of the frequency standards field mainly because of the high spec- tral resolution, and therefore the potential stability and accuracy, which can be achieved. In this thesis a new optical clock based on neutral atoms trapped in an optical lattice is presented, demonstrating spectroscopy of the clock transition free of any lineshape or accuracy degradation due to atomic motion. The system simu- lates a single trapped ion clock, but allows use of thousands of atoms for improved signal to noise ratio, and clock stability. High accuracy can also be achieved as the lattice can be designed to shift the energy of the two atomic clock states equally, such that the transition frequency is unchanged. Strontium is a natural candidate for such a clock as it offers an extremely narrow optical transition (∼1 mHz) based on atomic states which are very insensitive to external fields. The strontium level structure allows efficient laser cooling to 1 µK with diode laser sources, and a con- venient wavelength of 813 nm for the zero-differential Stark shift optical lattice. The strontium lattice clock system has allowed observation of high signal-to-noise spectral features with the largest line quality factor ever observed in coherent spectroscopy (Q > 2×1014), attesting to the stability of the clock. The effects of nuclear spin in the Sr isotope used are explored in how it pertains to the potential accuracy of the clock. The clock accuracy is evaluated at a fractional level of 9×10−16, representing the first time a neutral atom optical clock has reached an accuracy comparable to the primary Cs fountains. The optical frequency is then measured using a fs-comb referenced to the NIST Cs standard via a calibrated hydrogen maser. The final frequency value of 429,228,004,229,874.0(1.1) Hz is in excellent agreement with other measurements from labs around the world, and represents one of the most accurate optical frequency measurements to date.},

abstract = {Quantum phase estimation (QPE) is the workhorse behind any quantum algorithm and a promising method for determining ground state energies of strongly correlated quantum systems. Low-cost QPE techniques make use of circuits which only use a single ancilla qubit, requiring classical post-processing to extract eigenvalue details of the system. We investigate choices for phase estimation for a unitary matrix with low-depth noise-free or noisy circuits, varying both the phase estimation circuits themselves as well as the classical post-processing to determine the eigenvalue phases. We work in the scenario when the input state is not an eigenstate of the unitary matrix. We develop a new post-processing technique to extract eigenvalues from phase estimation data based on a classical time-series (or frequency) analysis and contrast this to an analysis via Bayesian methods. We calculate the variance in estimating single eigenvalues via the time-series analysis analytically, finding that it scales to first order in the number of experiments performed, and to first or second order (depending on the experiment design) in the circuit depth. Numerical simulations confirm this scaling for both estimators. We attempt to compensate for the noise with both classical post-processing techniques, finding good results in the presence of depolarizing noise, but smaller improvements in 9-qubit circuit-level simulations of superconducting qubits aimed at resolving the electronic ground state of a H 4-molecule.},

By employing adiabatic dressing of the ground electronic state, we can protect the gate from decoherence due to random phase errors that typically arise because of atomic thermal motion. In addition, the adiabatic protocol allows for a Doppler-free configuration that involves counterpropagating lasers in a $\sigma$+/$\sigma$- orthogonal polarization geometry that further reduces motional errors due to Doppler shifts. The residual motional error is dominated by dipole-dipole forces acting on doubly excited Rydberg atoms when the blockade is imperfect. For reasonable parameters, with qubits encoded into the clock states of Cs133, we predict that our protocol could produce a cz gate in <10 $\mu$s with error probability on the order of 10-3.},

abstract = {We have shown previously that the AKT2 pathway is essential for cell survival and important in malignant transformation. In this study, we demonstrate elevated kinase levels of AKT2 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) in 32 of 80 primary breast carcinomas. The majority of the cases with the activation are estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) positive, which prompted us to examine whether AKT2 regulates ERalpha activity. We found that constitutively activated AKT2 or AKT2 activated by epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-1 promotes the transcriptional activity of ERalpha. This effect occurred in the absence or presence of estrogen. Activated AKT2 phosphorylates ERalpha in vitro and in vivo, but it does not phosphorylate a mutant ERalpha in which ser-167 was replaced by Ala. The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, abolishes both the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of ERalpha induced by AKT2. However, AKT2-induced ERalpha activity was not inhibited by tamoxifen but was completely abolished by ICI 164,384, implicating that AKT2-activated ERalpha contributes to tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, we found that ERalpha binds to the p85alpha regulatory subunit of PI3K in the absence or presence of estradiol in epithelial cells and subsequently activates PI3K/AKT2, suggesting ERalpha regulation of PI3K/AKT2 through a nontranscriptional and ligand-independent mechanism. These data indicate that regulation between the ERalpha and PI3K/AKT2 pathway (ERalpha-PI3K/AKT2-ERalpha) may play an important role in pathogenesis of human breast cancer and could contribute to ligand-independent breast cancer cell growth.},

The time-dependent approach to the subject is emphasized, starting with the use of time-dependent formalism to define all of the basic concepts and the subsequent introduction of the time-independent theory as a tool for computation and for establishing certain general properties.

Focusing on the Sherrington- Kirkpatrick spin glass as an example, we find a system-size independent distribution of the duration of pulses, with characteristic time scale set by the inverse of the coupling constants in the Hamiltonian. The optimality of the bang-bang protocols and the characteristic time scale of the pulses provide an efficient parametrization of the protocol and inform the search for effective hybrid (classical and quantum) schemes for tackling combinatorial optimization problems.

This schema is generated for arbitrary molecules by NWChem, conveniently accessible, for instance, through Docker containers and a recently developed web interface EMSL Arrows.

entanglement via Rydberg interactions.
In the context of single-atom physics, we demonstrate trapping in tweezer arrays of
one- and two-dimensions as well as cooling to the motional ground state. We furthermore show high-fidelity single-atom imaging with extremely low loss, allowing
us to image the same atoms thousands of times before losing them and in principle
allowing for the assembly of defect-free atom arrays of several hundred sites.
Notably, we show these results in tweezers that are at a magic wavelength for
strontium's clock transition. This feature allows us to perform high-fidelity state
rotations on the clock transition. We also demonstrate operation of a single-site
resolved atomic-array optical clock — a new atomic clock platform that combines
several benefits of optical lattice and single-ion clocks.
From the metastable clock state, we drive the atoms to highly-excited Rydberg states
to introduce interactions between nearby atoms. Using a Rydberg blockade in an
assembled array of atom pairs, we demonstrate generation of two-atom entangled
Bell states with a fidelity of >98%, or >99% with correction for state preparation
and measurement errors. Furthermore, we demonstrate an auto-ionization statedetection scheme for Rydberg atoms which improves on the infidelity of previous
Rydberg state-detection schemes by over an order of magnitude.

With this approach, we achieve trapping and optical clock excited-state lifetimes exceeding $ 40 $ seconds in ensembles of approximately $ 150 $ atoms. This leads to half-minute-scale atomic coherence on an optical clock transition, corresponding to quality factors well in excess of $10^{16}$. These coherence times and atom numbers reduce the effect of quantum projection noise to a level that is on par with leading atomic systems, yielding a relative fractional frequency stability of $5.2(3)\times10^{-17}\sim(\tau/s)^{-1/2}$ for synchronous clock comparisons between sub-ensembles within the tweezer array.

abstract = {A projective measurement of energy (PME) on a quantum system is a quantum measurement determined by the Hamiltonian of the system. PME protocols exist when the Hamiltonian is given in advance. Unknown Hamiltonians can be identified by quantum tomography, but the time cost to achieve a given accuracy increases exponentially with the size of the quantum system. In this Letter, we improve the time cost by adapting quantum phase estimation, an algorithm designed for computational problems, to measurements on physical systems. We present a PME protocol without quantum tomography for Hamiltonians whose dimension and energy scale are given but which are otherwise unknown. Our protocol implements a PME to arbitrary accuracy without any dimension dependence on its time cost. We also show that another computational quantum algorithm may be used for efficient estimation of the energy scale. These algorithms show that computational quantum algorithms, with suitable modifications, have applications beyond their original context. Introduction.-The projective measurement of energy (PME) is a quantum counterpart of an ideal energy measurement in classical mechanics. A PME on a given system sets the system to an energy eigenstate and returns the corresponding energy eigenvalue. A PME alone has no effect on a system already in an energy eigenstate; thus, by repeating the same PME and observing that the outcomes remain unchanged, it can be used to confirm that the system remains in the initial energy eigenstate. These properties make the PME suitable for detecting small effects on a quantum system that is subject to an external influence such as a gravity wave [1] or thermal fluctuation [2-4]. In practice, a device that implements a quantum measurement must include a destructive component such as a photon detector. The PME, a nondestructive measurement, requires another quantum system as a "probe." The system (commonly referred to as the "target") interacts with the probe, and a direct measurement is performed only on the probe after the interaction (Fig. 1). An implementation protocol of PME is known for systems for which the Hamiltonian H is given in advance [5]. The protocol chooses the interaction between the probe and target according to H, so that the two quantum systems are appropriately entangled. The entanglement ensures that the measurement on the probe sets the target to an energy eigenstate, and that the outcome of the measurement identifies the respective energy eigenvalue. The time needed to induce the entanglement can be made arbitrarily short by increasing the strength of the interaction. Thus, the PME of a known H can, in principle, be implemented instantaneously.},

abstract = {1 Abstract Quantum computation is a promising tool for future research on physics and chemistry. The current quantum computers are in the noisy intermediate-scale (NISQ) era. It will take many years before universal quantum computers will exist that can outperform current classical computers. However, even in the NISQ-era quantum computers can be used in practice. One such application is the vari-ational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. This algorithm tries to find the ground state of a quantum mechanical system by trying to estimate the lowest eigenvalue of its Hamiltonian. Important ingredients in the VQE algorithm are the method of entangling the qubits and the classical optimization algorithm. In this thesis the VQE algorithm will be simulated for ground state energy estimations on small molecules (H 2 , LiH, H 2 O, etc.). The influence of different entangling method and the classical optimization algorithms on the energy estimations will be the focus of this research. Entangling methods based on a physical interaction of qubits such as the Krawtchouk chain or Rydberg interaction were found to perform as well in the VQE algorithm as textbook entanglers such as combinations of CNOT gates do. Results show that analyzing the VQE problem is incredibly complex, where the optimization algorithm, the method of entangling and the dimensionality of the search space all interact. In specific cases however, there is some order in the chaos and one can recommend using an entangling method or optimization algorithm over others. For instance for high dimensionality (many qubits and/or entanglement depth) the global DIRECT algorithm outperforms the local SPSA algorithm. A characterization of entanglement methods based on a scrambling measure was made, however, this yielded no useful results. The amount of qubits used to describe the Hamiltonian of a system greatly influences the convergence speed and efficiency of the VQE algorithm. Therefore, it is important to reduce the amount of qubits based on prior knowledge or certain symmetries, whenever possible. In this thesis certain approaches to reduce the amount of qubits are introduced. The thesis includes a elaborate proof on a reduction scheme for qubits based on Z 2 symmetries in the Hamiltonian. This scheme enables simplifications of certain VQE problems. For instance, the Hamiltonian for H 2 is reduced from two qubits to one qubit and the Hamiltonian for LiH is reduced from six qubits to five. 1},

Understanding the mechanism behind pair formation is an ongoing challenge in the study of many strongly correlated fermionic systems3. Controllable many-body systems that host Cooper pairs would thus be desirable. Here we directly observe Cooper pairs in a mesoscopic two-dimensional Fermi gas. We apply an imaging scheme that enables us to extract the full in situ momentum distribution of a strongly interacting Fermi gas with single-particle and spin resolution4. Our ultracold gas enables us to freely tune between a completely non-interacting, unpaired system and weak attractions, where we find Cooper pair correlations at the Fermi surface. When increasing the attractive interactions even further, the pairs gradually turn into deeply bound molecules that break up the Fermi surface. Our mesoscopic system is closely related to the physics of nuclei, superconducting grains or quantum dots5–7. With the precise control over the interactions, particle number and potential landscape in our experiment, the observables we establish in this work provide an approach for answering longstanding questions concerning not only such mesoscopic systems but also their connection to the macroscopic world.},

abstract = {Mast cells produce a number of cytokines including IL-6. In view of the large amounts of de novo synthesis induced by the activation of rat peritoneal mast cells and previous observations of expression of this cytokine by human lung mast cells, we have studied the regulation of IL-6 production. We examined the hypothesis that mast cell IL-6 production is not related to previous histamine release. Highly purified rat peritoneal mast cells were activated with anti-IgE, calcium ionophore A23187, or LPS. Histamine was used as a marker of preformed mediator release and IL-6 production was assessed by using the B9 hybridoma growth factor bioassay. Anti-IgE activation of rat peritoneal mast cells induced IL-6 production and histamine release. In contrast, LPS activation induced substantial, serum-dependent, IL-6 production without a significant level of histamine release. No preformed IL-6 was detected in the cells. Calcium ionophore induced histamine release from mast cells to a greater extent than did anti-IgE, but no A23187-induced IL-6 production was observed. A23187-treated cells retained high viability and produced a significant amount of TNF-alpha. To further examine the concordance of IL-6 production and histamine release we used mast cell stabilizing drugs. Dexamethasone and nedocromil significantly inhibited IL-6 production in response to anti-IgE. Our results demonstrate that there is not a direct relationship between mast cell degranulation and IL-6 production. Our observations are important for understanding the role of mast cells in inflammation and for developing strategies to modulate mast cell function in disease. },

Such hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are popular for applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning. Due to its simplicity and hardware efficiency, random circuits are often proposed as initial guesses for exploring the space of quantum states. We show that the exponential dimension of Hilbert space and the gradient estimation complexity make this choice unsuitable for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms run on more than a few qubits. Specifically, we show that for a wide class of reasonable parameterized quantum circuits, the probability that the gradient along any reasonable direction is non-zero to some fixed precision is exponentially small as a function of the number of qubits. We argue that this is related to the 2-design characteristic of random circuits, and that solutions to this problem must be studied.},

abstract = {In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, solving the electronic structure problem from chemistry is considered as the ‘killer application' for near-term quantum devices. In spite of the success of variational hybrid quantum/classical algorithms in providing accurate energy profiles for small molecules, careful considerations are still required for the description of complicated features of potential energy surfaces. Because the current quantum resources are very limited, it is common to focus on a restricted part of the Hilbert space (determined by the set of active orbitals). While physically motivated, this approximation can severely impact the description of these complicated features. A perfect example is that of conical intersections (i.e. a singular point of degeneracy between electronic states), which are of primary importance to understand many prominent reactions. Designing active spaces so that the improved accuracy from a quantum computer is not rendered useless is key to finding useful applications of these promising devices within the field of chemistry. To answer this issue, we introduce a NISQ-friendly method called ‘state-averaged orbital-optimized variational quantum eigensolver' which combines two algorithms: (1) a state-averaged orbital-optimizer, and (2) a state-averaged VQE. To demonstrate the success of the method, we classically simulate it on a minimal Schiff base model (namely the formaldimine molecule CH2NH) relevant also for the photoisomerization in rhodopsin—a crucial step in the process of vision mediated by the presence of a conical intersection. We show that merging both algorithms fulfil the necessary condition to describe the molecule's conical intersection, i.e. the ability to treat degenerate (or quasi-degenerate) states on the same footing.},

abstract = {Objective: This study tested the hypothesis that individual and family factors associated with adolescent risky sexual behavior (RSB) operate differently in their relationship to RSB among girls who have experienced forced sexual intercourse (FSI), as compared to those who have not. Method: Data were collected from 3,863 eighth-grade girls from a larger statewide sample. Different subgroups of participants received different sets of questions, so 655 to 2548 students were included in each analysis. Multilevel modeling was used to examine relationships of individual (social negotiation skills, personal safety, depression, sensation-seeking personality) and family factors (sibling deviance, parental monitoring, and quality of family relationships) to RSB. FSI was examined as a predictor of RSB and as a moderator of the relationship between individual and family variables and sexual risk. Results: Individual predictors: Social negotiation skills were associated with lower RSB for all girls, but had a stronger relationship to RSB among girls who had experienced FSI. Depression and sensation-seeking tendencies had small positive relationships to RSB for all girls. Family predictors: For girls without a history of FSI, parental monitoring was associated with lower sexual risk behavior. However, among girls who had experienced FSI, parental monitoring was not significantly related to RSB, but sibling deviance was associated with lower RSB. Conclusions: Results suggest that social negotiation skills and parental monitoring may warrant further attention in research and intervention.},

Current quantum devices have serious constraints, including limited numbers of qubits and noise processes that limit circuit depth. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which use a classical optimizer to train a parameterized quantum circuit, have emerged as a leading strategy to address these constraints. VQAs have now been proposed for essentially all applications that researchers have envisaged for quantum computers, and they appear to be the best hope for obtaining quantum advantage. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including the trainability, accuracy and efficiency of VQAs. Here we overview the field of VQAs, discuss strategies to overcome their challenges and highlight the exciting prospects for using them to obtain quantum advantage.},

We analyze two scenarios that are equivalent on the two-body level but differ in their realization in three-body multichannel spin space. The deviations in the Efimov spectra of these scenarios are caused by trimer states in the closed interaction channels whose binding energy and coupling strength to the Efimov states depend on the spin realization. However, in the narrow resonance limit the Efimov spectrum is set by the resonance width parameter r∗ only and does not depend on the realization in spin space. We find this limit to be even independent of the interaction potential considered. In the broad resonance limit all excited Efimov trimer energies approach the ones from the corresponding single-channel system for the scenarios investigated.},

abstract = {Computing the electronic structure of molecules with high precision is a central challenge in the field of quantum chemistry. Despite the success of approximate methods, tackling this problem exactly with conventional computers remains a formidable task. Several theoretical1,2 and experimental3–5 attempts have been made to use quantum computers to solve chemistry problems, with early proof-of-principle realizations done digitally. An appealing alternative to the digital approach is analogue quantum simulation, which does not require a scalable quantum computer and has already been successfully applied to solve condensed matter physics problems6–8. However, not all available or planned setups can be used for quantum chemistry problems, because it is not known how to engineer the required Coulomb interactions between them. Here we present an analogue approach to the simulation of quantum chemistry problems that relies on the careful combination of two technologies: ultracold atoms in optical lattices and cavity quantum electrodynamics. In the proposed simulator, fermionic atoms hopping in an optical potential play the role of electrons, additional optical potentials provide the nuclear attraction, and a single-spin excitation in a Mott insulator mediates the electronic Coulomb repulsion with the help of a cavity mode. We determine the operational conditions of the simulator and test it using a simple molecule. Our work opens up the possibility of efficiently computing the electronic structures of molecules with analogue quantum simulation.},

abstract = {Quantum computers can be used to address electronic-structure problems and problems in materials science and condensed matter physics that can be formulated as interacting fermionic problems, problems which stretch the limits of existing high-performance computers. Finding exact solutions to such problems numerically has a computational cost that scales exponentially with the size of the system, and Monte Carlo methods are unsuitable owing to the fermionic sign problem. These limitations of classical computational methods have made solving even few-atom electronic-structure problems interesting for implementation using medium-sized quantum computers. Yet experimental implementations have so far been restricted to molecules involving only hydrogen and helium. Here we demonstrate the experimental optimization of Hamiltonian problems with up to six qubits and more than one hundred Pauli terms, determining the ground-state energy for molecules of increasing size, up to BeH2. We achieve this result by using a variational quantum eigenvalue solver (eigensolver) with efficiently prepared trial states that are tailored specifically to the interactions that are available in our quantum processor, combined with a compact encoding of fermionic Hamiltonians and a robust stochastic optimization routine. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by applying it to a problem of quantum magnetism, an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model in an external magnetic field. In all cases, we find agreement between our experiments and numerical simulations using a model of the device with noise. Our results help to elucidate the requirements for scaling the method to larger systems and for bridging the gap between key problems in high-performance computing and their implementation on quantum hardware.},

Remarkably, this reduction can be achieved for smooth pulses in detuning and smooth turning on of the Rabi frequency as required in any experimental realization. We carefully analyze the influence of fundamental error sources such as the photon recoil and the microscopic interaction potential, as well as the harmonic trapping of the atoms for an experimentally realistic setup based on strontium-88 atoms.

abstract = {Given a universal gate set on two qubits, it is well known that applying random gates from the set to random pairs of qubits will eventually yield an approximately Haar-distributed unitary. However, this requires exponential time. We show that random circuits of only polynomial length will approximate the first and second moments of the Haar distribution, thus forming approximate 1- and 2-designs. Previous constructions required longer circuits and worked only for specific gate sets. As a corollary of our main result, we also improve previous bounds on the convergence rate of random walks on the Clifford group. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract = {We report the first electronic structure calculation performed on a quantum computer without exponentially costly precompilation. We use a programmable array of superconducting qubits to compute the energy surface of molecular hydrogen using two distinct quantum algorithms. First, we experimentally execute the unitary coupled cluster method using the variational quantum eigensolver. Our efficient implementation predicts the correct dissociation energy to within chemical accuracy of the numerically exact result. Second, we experimentally demonstrate the canonical quantum algorithm for chemistry, which consists of Trotterization and quantum phase estimation. We compare the experimental performance of these approaches to show clear evidence that the variational quantum eigensolver is robust to certain errors. This error tolerance inspires hope that variational quantum simulations of classically intractable molecules may be viable in the near future.},

abstract = {A metric tensor is defined from the underlying Hilbert space structure for any submanifold of quantum states. The case where the manifold is generated by the action of a Lie group on a fixed state vector (generalized coherent states manifold hereafter noted G.C.S.M.) is studied in details; the geometrical properties of some wellknown G.C.S.M. are reviewed and an explicit expression for the scalar Riemannian curvature is given in the general case. The physical meaning of such Riemannian structures (which have been recently introduced to describe collective manifolds in nuclear physics) is discussed. It is shown on examples that the distance between nearby states is related to quantum fluctuations; in the particular case of the harmonic oscillator group the condition of zero curvature appears to be identical to that of non dispersion of wave packets.},

abstract = {Experimental studies of synthetic quantum matter are necessarily restricted to approximate ground states prepared on finite-size quantum simulators. In general, this limits their reliability for strongly correlated systems, for instance, in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition (QPT). Here, we propose a protocol that makes optimal use of a given finite-size simulator by directly preparing, on its bulk region, a mixed state representing the reduced density operator of the translation-invariant infinite-sized system of interest. This protocol is based on coherent evolution with a local deformation of the system Hamiltonian. For systems of free fermions in one and two spatial dimensions, we illustrate and explain the underlying physics, which consists of quasiparticle transport towards the system's boundaries while retaining the bulk "vacuum."For the example of a nonintegrable extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we demonstrate that our protocol enables a more accurate study of QPTs. In addition, we demonstrate the protocol for an interacting spinful Fermi-Hubbard model with doping for one-dimensional chains and a small two-leg ladder, where the initial state is a random superposition of energetically low-lying states.},

It was proposed a decade ago to take advantage of these properties to implement quantum gates between neutral atom qubits. The availability of a strong long-range interaction that can be coherently turned on and off is an enabling resource for a wide range of quantum information tasks stretching far beyond the original gate proposal. Rydberg enabled capabilities include long-range two-qubit gates, collective encoding of multiqubit registers, implementation of robust light-atom quantum interfaces, and the potential for simulating quantum many-body physics.

abstract = {We introduce a method for digital preparation of ground states of simulated Hamiltonians, inspired by cooling in nature and adapted to leverage the capabilities of digital quantum hardware. The cold bath is simulated by a single ancillary qubit, which is reset periodically and coupled to the system nonperturbatively. Studying this cooling method on a 1-qubit system toy model, we optimize two cooling protocols based on weak-coupling and strong-coupling approaches. Extending the insight from the 1-qubit system model, we develop two scalable protocols for larger systems. The LogSweep protocol extends the weak-coupling approach by sweeping energies to resonantly match any targeted transition. We test LogSweep on the 1D transverse-field Ising model, demonstrating approximate ground-state preparation with an error that can be made polynomially small in the computation time for all three phases of the system. The BangBang protocol extends the strong-coupling approach, and exploits a heuristics for local Hamiltonians to maximize the probability of deexciting system transitions in the shortest possible time. Although this protocol does not promise long-time convergence, it allows for a rapid cooling to an approximation of the ground state, making this protocol appealing for near-term demonstrations.},

These originate from the fermion-to-qubit mapping applied to the electronic Hamiltonians. Current solutions to this problem rely on perturbation theory in an enlarged Hilbert space. The main challenge associated with this technique is that it relies on coupling constants with very different magnitudes. This prevents its implementation in currently available architectures. In order to resolve this issue, we present an optimization scheme that unfolds the k-local terms into a linear combination of 2-local terms, while ensuring the conservation of all relevant physical properties of the original Hamiltonian, with several orders of magnitude smaller variation of the coupling constants.},

abstract = {One of the most important application areas of molecular quantum chemistry is the study and prediction of chemical reactivity. Large-scale, fully error-tolerant quantum computers could provide exact or near-exact solutions to the underlying electronic structure problem with exponentially less effort than a classical computer thus enabling highly accurate predictions for comparably large molecular systems. In the nearer future, however, only "noisy" devices with a limited number of qubits that are subject to decoherence will be available. For such near-term quantum computers the hybrid quantum-classical variational quantum eigensolver algorithm in combination with the unitary coupled-cluster ansatz (UCCSD-VQE) [ Peruzzo et al. Nat. Commun. 2014, 5, 4213 and McClean et al. New J. Phys. 2016, 18, 023023 ] has become an intensively discussed approach that could provide accurate results before the dawn of error-tolerant quantum computing. In this work we present an implementation of UCCSD-VQE that allows for the first time to treat both open- and closed-shell molecules. We study the accuracy of the obtained energies for nine small molecular systems as well as for four exemplary chemical reactions by comparing to well-established electronic structure methods like (nonunitary) coupled-cluster and density functional theory. Finally, we roughly estimate the required quantum hardware resources to obtain "useful" results for practical purposes.},

Because of the exponential storage complexity of the spectral-element representation with the number of dimensions, a brute-force computation of two-electron (six-dimensional) wave functions with high precision was not practical. To overcome the key storage bottlenecks we utilized (1) a low-rank tensor approximation (specifically, the singular value decomposition) to compress the wave function, and (2) explicitly correlated R12-type terms in the wave function to regularize the Coulomb electron-electron singularities of the Hamiltonian. All operations necessary to solve the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation were expressed so that the reconstruction of the full-rank form of the wave function is never necessary. Numerical performance of the method was highlighted by computing the first-order Moller-Plesset wave function of a helium atom. The computed second-order Moller-Plesset energy is precise to ∼2 microhartrees, which is at the precision limit of the existing general atomic-orbital-based approaches.

Examples include calculating molecular and nuclear structure, simulating strongly interacting electron systems, and modeling aspects of material function. While substantial theoretical advances have been made in mapping these problems to quantum algorithms, there remains a large gap between the resource requirements for solving such problems and the capabilities of currently available quantum hardware. Bridging this gap will require a co-design approach, where the expression of algorithms is developed in conjunction with the hardware itself to optimize execution. Here we describe an extensible co-design framework for solving chemistry problems on a trapped-ion quantum computer and apply it to estimating the ground-state energy of the water molecule using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) method. The controllability of the trapped-ion quantum computer enables robust energy estimates using the prepared VQE ansatz states. The systematic and statistical errors are comparable to the chemical accuracy, which is the target threshold necessary for predicting the rates of chemical reaction dynamics, without resorting to any error mitigation techniques based on Richardson extrapolation.},

The no-hair theorem, which is also believed to be true in the theory of general relativity, suggests a particular value for the tidal Love number of a nonrotating black hole (k2=0). Using the Fisher matrix formalism, we examine the measurability of the spin and tidal deformability of compact binary systems involving at least one putative black hole. Using parameter measurement errors and correlations obtained from the Fisher matrix, we determine the smallest detectable violation of bounds implied by the cosmic censorship conjecture and the no-hair theorem. We examine the effect of excluding unphysical areas of parameter space when determining the smallest detectable apparent violations, and we examine the effect of different post-Newtonian corrections to the amplitude of the compact binary coalescence gravitational waveform, as given in Arun et al.. In addition, we perform a brief study of how the recently calculated 3.0 pN and 3.5 pN spin-orbit corrections to the phase [Marsat et al., Classical Quantum Gravity 30, 055007 (2013)] affect spin and mass parameter measurability.

In the 3-body sector for identical bosons, the universal properties include the existence of a sequence of shallow 3-body bound states called "Efimov states" and log-periodic dependence of scattering observables on the energy and the scattering length. The spectrum of Efimov states in the limit a → ± ∞ is characterized by an asymptotic discrete scaling symmetry that is the signature of renormalization group flow to a limit cycle. In this review, we present a thorough treatment of universality for the system of three identical bosons and we summarize the universal information that is currently available for other 3-body systems. Our basic tools are the hyperspherical formalism to provide qualitative insights, Efimov's radial laws for deriving the constraints from unitarity, and effective field theory for quantitative calculations.

abstract = {The problem of finding the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian using a quantum computer is currently solved using either the quantum phase estimation (QPE) or variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithms. For precision ϵ, QPE requires O(1) repetitions of circuits with depth O(1/ϵ), whereas each expectation estimation subroutine within VQE requires O(1/ϵ2) samples from circuits with depth O(1). We propose a generalized VQE algorithm that interpolates between these two regimes via a free parameter $\alpha$[0,1], which can exploit quantum coherence over a circuit depth of O(1/ϵ$\alpha$) to reduce the number of samples to O(1/ϵ2(1-$\alpha$)). Along the way, we give a new routine for expectation estimation under limited quantum resources that is of independent interest.},

However, controlled two-qubit entanglement generation has so far been limited to alkali species, leaving the exploitation of more complex electronic structures as an open frontier that could lead to improved fidelities and fundamentally different applications such as quantum-enhanced optical clocks. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach utilizing the two-valence electron structure of individual alkaline-earth Rydberg atoms. We find fidelities for Rydberg state detection, single-atom Rabi operations and two-atom entanglement that surpass previously published values.

@article{Schuld2019,
abstract = {An important application for near-term quantum computing lies in optimization tasks, with applications ranging from quantum chemistry and drug discovery to machine learning. In many settings, most prominently in so-called parametrized or variational algorithms, the objective function is a result of hybrid quantum-classical processing. To optimize the objective, it is useful to have access to exact gradients of quantum circuits with respect to gate parameters. This paper shows how gradients of expectation values of quantum measurements can be estimated using the same, or almost the same, architecture that executes the original circuit. It generalizes previous results for qubit-based platforms, and proposes recipes for the computation of gradients of continuous-variable circuits. Interestingly, in many important instances it is sufficient to run the original quantum circuit twice while shifting a single gate parameter to obtain the corresponding component of the gradient. More general cases can be solved by conditioning a single gate on an ancilla.},

While VQAs may enable practical applications of noisy quantum computers, they are nevertheless heuristic methods with unproven scaling. Here, we rigorously prove two results, assuming V($\theta$) is an alternating layered ansatz composed of blocks forming local 2-designs. Our first result states that defining C in terms of global observables leads to exponentially vanishing gradients (i.e., barren plateaus) even when V($\theta$) is shallow. Hence, several VQAs in the literature must revise their proposed costs. On the other hand, our second result states that defining C with local observables leads to at worst a polynomially vanishing gradient, so long as the depth of V($\theta$) is O(logn). Our results establish a connection between locality and trainability. We illustrate these ideas with large-scale simulations, up to 100 qubits, of a quantum autoencoder implementation.},

@article{Bravyi2022a,
abstract = {We consider quantum circuits composed of single-qubit operations and global entangling gates generated by Ising-type Hamiltonians. It is shown that such circuits can implement a large class of unitary operators commonly used in quantum algorithms at a very low cost-using a constant or effectively constant number of global entangling gates. Specifically, we report constant-cost implementations of Clifford operations with and without ancillae, constant-cost implementation of the multiply-controlled gates with linearly many ancillae, and an Oðlog {\~{A}} ðnÞÞ cost implementation of the n-controlled single-target gates using logarithmically many ancillae. This shows a significant asymptotic advantage of circuits enabled by the global entangling gates. Executing a quantum computer program requires its compilation to native gates directly supported by the controlling apparatus. While most of the existing quantum computing hardware supports arbitrary single-qubit gates as their native physical-level instruction, the choice of entangling multiqubit operations may vary strongly across different platforms. Here we focus on leveraging parallel global instructions available in some quantum computer architectures [1-3]. Such global operations draw their power from the ability to apply a layer of pairwise commuting 2-qubit gates simultaneously. A notable example is the Molmer-Sorensen gate available in the trapped-ion architecture [2,4] that evolves a system of qubits under the Ising-type Hamiltonian. In this Letter, we report a streamlined implementation of two common quantum computing subroutines enabled by global entangling gates: elements of the Clifford group and multiply-controlled gates. Clifford operations play a central role in quantum error correction, certain simulation algorithms [5], and a variety of applications based on pseudorandom unitary operators [6-8]. Multiply-controlled gates are ubiquitous in applications that rely on arithmetic circuits or the quantum singular value transformation [9,10]. We consider computational primitives that implement a selectable set of commuting two-body Ising interactions in one go, which we call global tunable gates. We furthermore treat single-qubit gates as a free resource, which is justified since the implementation of entangling operators on the physical level tends to be more difficult and error prone compared with the single-qubit gates. Such a selection of the costing metric implies that the particular nature of the Ising interaction (e.g., XX; YY; ZZ) used is irrelevant-indeed, the results hold uniformly for all possible choices of the interaction since the changes between them are accomplished by the single-qubit gates (basis change) and can be merged into the single-qubit gate layers. For the sake of simplicity of mathematical expressions , we chose to work with the CZ a interaction defined as CZ a ¼ e i$\pi$aj11ih11j. Here a ∈ ½0; 1 is a tunable parameter. In other words, CZ 0 is equivalent to the identity, whereas CZ 1 ¼ CZ is single-qubit equivalent to the CNOT gate. We define an n-qubit global tunable (GT) gate as a diagonal unitary operator Y 1≤i<j≤n CZ aði;jÞ i;j ; where i and j indicate pairs of qubits acted upon by each CZ a gate, and we allow the parameter a ¼ aði; jÞ to be tuned individually for each pair of qubits i and j. We assume all-to-all qubit connectivity. Multiple versions of GT gates have been experimentally demonstrated [1,2,11,12]. In particular, Ref. [2] showed that the pulse complexity required for a GT gate is not much more than that required for a single 2-qubit gate, i.e., 3n − 1 degrees of freedom used for a GT instruction and 2n þ 1 for a 2-qubit gate, for an n-qubit quantum computer. This is understood by considering the pulse design space, where some number of degrees of freedom must first be spent to decouple the computational states from the mutually shared information bus at the end of the entangling operation (2n) and then using additional degrees of freedom to induce the desired degree of entanglement between qubit pairs of PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 129, 230501 (2022)},

In the search for achieving quantum advantage with these devices, algorithms have been proposed for applications in various disciplines spanning physics, machine learning, quantum chemistry, and combinatorial optimization. The overarching goal of such algorithms is to leverage the limited available resources to perform classically challenging tasks. In this review, a thorough summary of NISQ computational paradigms and algorithms is provided. The key structure of these algorithms and their limitations and advantages are discussed.

abstract = {Interacting ultracold atomic quantum gases provide an ideal test bed to study strongly correlated quantum matter. The interactions between atoms in such an ultracold quantum gas are typically short-ranged and well described by an effective contact po-tential. Introducing longer-range interactions promises the realization of novel quan-tum phases which are absent in systems with only short-range interactions. Trapped atoms, resonantly laser-coupled to highly excited, strongly interacting Ryd-berg states have been proposed as a versatile platform to realize such long-range in-teracting quantum matter. In a first experiment presented in this thesis, we combined the single-atom-sensitive local preparation and detection enabled by a quantum gas microscope to prepare and microscopically characterize an ensemble of rubidium-87 atoms trapped in an optical lattice in the regime of strong Rydberg blockade. There, we observe collectively enhanced optical coupling in an effective two-level system, the so-called “superatom”, and infer the presence of entanglement. Detuned optical coupling to Rydberg states, termed “Rydberg dressing”, has been proposed as an alternative approach to induce long-range interactions. Rather than directly exciting an atom to a Rydberg state, the properties of the latter are admixed to a ground state, which consequently acquires long-range interactions. In the con-text of this thesis, we have designed a laser system in the ultraviolet spectral range to admix RydbergP -state character to the ground state of atoms in an optical lattice. In an emerging Ising quantum magnet, the presence of Rydberg-dressed interactions was demonstrated by an interferometric technique combined with spatially resolved spin correlation measurements. The theoretically predicted tunability of the isotropy and range of the interaction were confirmed experimentally. While these initial measurements exhibited unexpected dissipation, in a subsequent experiment in a one-dimensional spin chain this dissipation was overcome. We sub-stantiated the improved coherence times by tracking the time evolution of the mag-netization upon suddenly switching on interactions and observing coherent collapse and revival dynamics, one of the hallmarks of coherent quantum evolution. Our re-sults establish Rydberg-dressed interactions in ultracold gases and pave the way to realize and study novel exotic quantum phases.},

We performed several quantum simulations of chemistry with up to one dozen qubits, including modeling the isomerization mechanism of diazene. We also demonstrated error-mitigation strategies based on N-representability that dramatically improve the effective fidelity of our experiments. Our parameterized ansatz circuits realized the Givens rotation approach to noninteracting fermion evolution, which we variationally optimized to prepare the Hartree-Fock wave function. This ubiquitous algorithmic primitive is classically tractable to simulate yet still generates highly entangled states over the computational basis, which allowed us to assess the performance of our hardware and establish a foundation for scaling up correlated quantum chemistry simulations.},

The level of control that has been achieved at the single particle level within arrays of optical traps, while preserving the fundamental properties of quantum matter (coherence, entanglement, superposition), makes these technologies prime candidates to implement disruptive computation paradigms. In this paper, we review the main characteristics of these devices from atoms / qubits to application interfaces, and propose a classification of a wide variety of tasks that can already be addressed in a computationally efficient manner in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum[1] era we are in. We illustrate how applications ranging from optimization challenges to simulation of quantum systems can be explored either at the digital level (programming gate-based circuits) or at the analog level (programming Hamiltonian sequences). We give evidence of the intrinsic scalability of neutral atom quantum processors in the 100-1,000 qubits range and introduce prospects for universal fault tolerant quantum computing and applications beyond quantum computing.},

abstract = {We develop a quantum filter diagonalization method (QFD) that lies somewhere between the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and the phase estimation algorithm (PEA) in terms of required quantum circuit resources and conceptual simplicity. QFD uses a set of of time-propagated guess states as a variational basis for approximate diagonalization of a sparse Pauli Hamiltonian. The variational coefficients of the basis functions are determined by the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure by classically solving a generalized eigenvalue problem in the space of time-propagated guess states. The matrix elements of the subspace Hamiltonian and subspace metric matrix are each determined in quantum circuits by a one-ancilla extended swap test, i.e., statistical convergence of a one-ancilla PEA circuit. These matrix elements can be determined by many parallel quantum circuit evaluations, and the final Ritz estimates for the eigenvectors can conceptually be prepared as a linear combination over separate quantum state preparation circuits. The QFD method naturally provides for the computation of ground-state, excited-state, and transition expectation values. We numerically demonstrate the potential of the method by classical simulations of the QFD algorithm for an N=8 octamer of BChl-a chromophores represented by an 8-qubit ab initio exciton model (AIEM) Hamiltonian. Using only a handful of time-displacement points and a coarse, variational Trotter expansion of the time propagation operators, the QFD method recovers an accurate prediction of the absorption spectrum.},

abstract = {Solving the electronic structure problem using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) technique involves the measurement of the Hamiltonian expectation value. The current hardware can perform only projective single-qubit measurements, and thus, the Hamiltonian expectation value is obtained by measuring parts of the Hamiltonian rather than the full Hamiltonian. This restriction makes the measurement process inefficient because the number of terms in the Hamiltonian grows as O(N4) with the size of the system, N. To optimize the VQE measurement, one can try to group as many Hamiltonian terms as possible for their simultaneous measurement. Single-qubit measurements allow one to group only the terms commuting within the corresponding single-qubit subspaces or qubit-wise commuting. We found that the qubit-wise commutativity between the Hamiltonian terms can be expressed as a graph and the problem of the optimal grouping is equivalent to finding a minimum clique cover (MCC) for the Hamiltonian graph. The MCC problem is NP-hard, but there exist several polynomial heuristic algorithms to solve it approximately. Several of these heuristics were tested in this work for a set of molecular electronic Hamiltonians. On average, grouping qubit-wise commuting terms reduced the number of operators to measure three times less compared to the total number of terms in the considered Hamiltonians.},

abstract = {A model master equation suitable for quantum computing dynamics is presented. In an ideal quantum computer (QC), a system of qubits evolves in time unitarily and, by virtue of their entanglement, interfere quantum mechanically to solve otherwise intractable problems. In the real situation, a QC is subject to decoherence and attenuation effects due to interaction with an environment and with possible short-term random disturbances and gate deficiencies. The stability of a QC under such attacks is a key issue for the development of realistic devices. We assume that the influence of the environment can be incorporated by a master equation that includes unitary evolution with gates, supplemented by a Lindblad term. Lindblad operators of various types are explored; namely, steady, pulsed, gate friction, and measurement operators. In the master equation, we use the Lindblad term to describe short time intrusions by random Lindblad pulses. The phenomenological master equation is then extended to include a nonlinear Beretta term that describes the evolution of a closed system with increasing entropy. An external Bath environment is stipulated by a fixed temperature in two different ways. Here we explore the case of a simple one-qubit system in preparation for generalization to multi-qubit, qutrit and hybrid qubit–qutrit systems. This model master equation can be used to test the stability of memory and the efficacy of quantum gates. The properties of such hybrid master equations are explored, with emphasis on the role of thermal equilibrium and entropy constraints. Several significant properties of time-dependent qubit evolution are revealed by this simple study.},

Low-cost QPE techniques make use of circuits which only use a single ancilla qubit, requiring classical post-processing to extract eigenvalue details of the system. We investigate choices for phase estimation for a unitary matrix with low-depth noise-free or noisy circuits, varying both the phase estimation circuits themselves as well as the classical post-processing to determine the eigenvalue phases. We work in the scenario when the input state is not an eigenstate of the unitary matrix. We develop a new post-processing technique to extract eigenvalues from phase estimation data based on a classical time-series (or frequency) analysis and contrast this to an analysis via Bayesian methods. We calculate the variance in estimating single eigenvalues via the time-series analysis analytically, finding that it scales to first order in the number of experiments performed, and to first or second order (depending on the experiment design) in the circuit depth. Numerical simulations confirm this scaling for both estimators. We attempt to compensate for the noise with both classical post-processing techniques, finding good results in the presence of depolarizing noise, but smaller improvements in 9-qubit circuit-level simulations of superconducting qubits aimed at resolving the electronic ground state of a H4-molecule.},

abstract = {A central component of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) is the state-preparation circuit, also known as ansatz or variational form. This circuit is most commonly designed such as to exploit symmetries of the problem Hamiltonian and, in this way, constrain the variational search to a subspace of interest. Here, we show that this approach is not always advantageous by introducing ansatzes that incorporate symmetry-breaking unitaries. This class of ansatzes, that we call quantum-optimal-Control-inspired ansates (QOCA), is inspired by the theory of quantum optimal control and leads to an improved convergence of VQAs for some important problems. Indeed, we benchmark QOCA against popular variational forms applied to the Fermi-Hubbard model at half-filling and show that our variational circuits can approximate the ground state of this model with high accuracy.

abstract = { We develop a method to synthesize a class of entangling multi-qubit gates for a quantum computing platform with fixed Ising-type interaction with all-to-all connectivity. The only requirement on the flexibility of the interaction is that it can be switched on and off for individual qubits. Our method yields a time-optimal implementation of the multi-qubit gates. We numerically demonstrate that the total multi-qubit gate time scales approximately linear in the number of qubits. Using this gate synthesis as a subroutine, we provide compilation strategies for important use cases: (i) we show that any Clifford circuit on  n  qubits can be implemented using at most  2 n  multi-qubit gates without requiring ancilla qubits, (ii) we decompose the quantum Fourier transform in a similar fashion, (iii) we compile a simulation of molecular dynamics, and (iv) we propose a method for the compilation of diagonal unitaries with time-optimal multi-qubit gates, as a step towards general unitaries. As motivation, we provide a detailed discussion on a microwave controlled ion trap architecture with magnetic gradient induced coupling (MAGIC) for the generation of the Ising-type interactions. },

Finite contrast is due to preparation and detection errors, and we show how to model and measure them accurately. Part of these errors originates from the finite lifetime of Rydberg states, and we observe its n3 scaling with the principal quantum number n. To explain the damping of Rabi oscillations, we use simple numerical models taking into account independently measured experimental imperfections and show that the observed damping actually results from the accumulation of several small effects, each at the level of a few percent. We discuss prospects for improving the coherence of ground-Rydberg Rabi oscillations in view of applications in quantum simulation and quantum information processing with arrays of single Rydberg atoms.},

These experiments exploit the rich electronic structure of these elements, which is markedly different from the one of other species for which quantum degeneracy has been attained. Specifically, alkaline-earth-like atoms, such as strontium, feature metastable triplet states, narrow intercombination lines, and a non-magnetic, closed-shell ground state. This review covers the creation of quantum degenerate gases of strontium and the first experiments performed with this new system. It focuses on laser-cooling and evaporation schemes, which enable the creation of Bose-Einstein condensates and degenerate Fermi gases of all strontium isotopes, and shows how they are used for the investigation of optical Feshbach resonances, the study of degenerate gases loaded into an optical lattice, as well as the coherent creation of Sr_2 molecules.},

This three-body effect was originally proposed to explain the binding of nuclei such as the triton and the Hoyle state of carbon-12, and later considered as a simple explanation for the existence of some halo nuclei. It was subsequently evidenced in trapped ultra-cold atomic clouds and in diffracted molecular beams of gaseous helium. These experiments revealed that the previously undetermined three-body parameter introduced in the Efimov theory to stabilise the three-body attraction typically scales with the range of atomic interactions. The few- and many-body consequences of the Efimov attraction have been since investigated theoretically, and are expected to be observed in a broader spectrum of physical systems.},

To fully characterize an unknown entangled state of n qubits, one requires an exponential number of measurements in n, which is experimentally unfeasible even for modest system sizes. By leveraging (i) that single-qubit measurements can be made in parallel, and (ii) the theory of perfect hash families, we show that all k-qubit reduced density matrices of an n qubit state can be determined with at most eO(k)log2(n) rounds of parallel measurements. We provide concrete measurement protocols which realize this bound. As an example, we argue that with near-term experiments, every two-point correlator in a system of 1024 qubits could be measured and completely characterized in a few days. This corresponds to determining nearly 4.5 million correlators.},

We discuss how quantum computers can augment classical computer simulations used to probe these reaction mechanisms, to significantly increase their accuracy and enable hitherto intractable simulations. Our resource estimates show that, even when taking into account the substantial overhead of quantum error correction, and the need to compile into discrete gate sets, the necessary computations can be performed in reasonable time on small quantum computers.

A fundamental question is whether these correlations could be harnessed to enhance learning performances on real data sets. Here we report the use of a neutral atom quantum processor comprising up to 32 qubits to implement machine learning tasks on graph-structured data. To that end, we introduce a quantum feature map to encode the information about graphs in the parameters of a tunable Hamiltonian acting on an array of qubits. Using this tool, we first show that interactions in the quantum system can be used to distinguish nonisomorphic graphs that are locally equivalent. We then realize a toxicity screening experiment, consisting of a binary classification protocol on a biochemistry data set comprising 286 molecules of sizes ranging from 2 to 32 nodes, and obtain results which are comparable to the implementation of the best classical kernels on the same data set. Using techniques to compare the geometry of the feature spaces associated with kernel methods, we then show evidence that the quantum feature map perceives data in an original way, which is hard to replicate using classical kernels.},

@article{Bravyi2022,
abstract = {We consider quantum circuits composed of single-qubit operations and global entangling gates generated by Ising-type Hamiltonians. It is shown that such circuits can implement a large class of unitary operators commonly used in quantum algorithms at a very low cost-using a constant or effectively constant number of global entangling gates. Specifically, we report constant-cost implementations of Clifford operations with and without ancillae, constant-cost implementation of the multiply-controlled gates with linearly many ancillae, and an Oðlog {\~{A}} ðnÞÞ cost implementation of the n-controlled single-target gates using logarithmically many ancillae. This shows a significant asymptotic advantage of circuits enabled by the global entangling gates. Executing a quantum computer program requires its compilation to native gates directly supported by the controlling apparatus. While most of the existing quantum computing hardware supports arbitrary single-qubit gates as their native physical-level instruction, the choice of entangling multiqubit operations may vary strongly across different platforms. Here we focus on leveraging parallel global instructions available in some quantum computer architectures [1-3]. Such global operations draw their power from the ability to apply a layer of pairwise commuting 2-qubit gates simultaneously. A notable example is the Molmer-Sorensen gate available in the trapped-ion architecture [2,4] that evolves a system of qubits under the Ising-type Hamiltonian. In this Letter, we report a streamlined implementation of two common quantum computing subroutines enabled by global entangling gates: elements of the Clifford group and multiply-controlled gates. Clifford operations play a central role in quantum error correction, certain simulation algorithms [5], and a variety of applications based on pseudorandom unitary operators [6-8]. Multiply-controlled gates are ubiquitous in applications that rely on arithmetic circuits or the quantum singular value transformation [9,10]. We consider computational primitives that implement a selectable set of commuting two-body Ising interactions in one go, which we call global tunable gates. We furthermore treat single-qubit gates as a free resource, which is justified since the implementation of entangling operators on the physical level tends to be more difficult and error prone compared with the single-qubit gates. Such a selection of the costing metric implies that the particular nature of the Ising interaction (e.g., XX; YY; ZZ) used is irrelevant-indeed, the results hold uniformly for all possible choices of the interaction since the changes between them are accomplished by the single-qubit gates (basis change) and can be merged into the single-qubit gate layers. For the sake of simplicity of mathematical expressions , we chose to work with the CZ a interaction defined as CZ a ¼ e i$\pi$aj11ih11j. Here a ∈ ½0; 1 is a tunable parameter. In other words, CZ 0 is equivalent to the identity, whereas CZ 1 ¼ CZ is single-qubit equivalent to the CNOT gate. We define an n-qubit global tunable (GT) gate as a diagonal unitary operator Y 1≤i<j≤n CZ aði;jÞ i;j ; where i and j indicate pairs of qubits acted upon by each CZ a gate, and we allow the parameter a ¼ aði; jÞ to be tuned individually for each pair of qubits i and j. We assume all-to-all qubit connectivity. Multiple versions of GT gates have been experimentally demonstrated [1,2,11,12]. In particular, Ref. [2] showed that the pulse complexity required for a GT gate is not much more than that required for a single 2-qubit gate, i.e., 3n − 1 degrees of freedom used for a GT instruction and 2n þ 1 for a 2-qubit gate, for an n-qubit quantum computer. This is understood by considering the pulse design space, where some number of degrees of freedom must first be spent to decouple the computational states from the mutually shared information bus at the end of the entangling operation (2n) and then using additional degrees of freedom to induce the desired degree of entanglement between qubit pairs of PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 129, 230501 (2022)},
