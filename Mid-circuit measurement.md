The unitary operators $E$ essentially function as information extractors. The mid-circuit measurement operation projects the information in superposition and extracts it to the classical system $f(x)$. The classical system them acts on the projected quantum state through some operation sequence $U(\theta)$. A more specific concept is presented in [[Energy projection with QPE]]. In fact, one may construct an arbitrary operator $M$ to measure using the QPE technique, projecting the $|\psi\rangle$ into eigenstate bands, defined by the extracted eigenvalues (of the designated operator $M$). 

The QPE technique usually has a large overhead, and so it might be useful to design more efficient information extraction circuits.
